To be able to use the face detection you have to firstly capture your images using the faceGrabber.py file. 
When you run it you will have to insert your name in the terminal so that the program creates a file the directory to save the images
that are going to be captured. 

After that the program is going to store the images (take as many as possible the more the better) and then press "Esc" key to stop.

After finishing the first part, you can then compile the second file faceTrainer.py so that the program processes your images, then recognises 
each one of them.
The compilation will take longer the more images are captured thus analysed by the program.

Please use "pip install opencv-contrib-python" to use the facetrainer.py file.
